Data Science and Business Analytics Capstone Project

# Data-Driven Business Insights & Predictive Modeling – Capstone

A single, end-to-end project that consolidates concepts from multiple DSBA projects: EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, hypothesis testing, classification, regression, clustering, time-series trend, and business recommendations.

## Dataset
Synthetic unified dataset joining **customers**, **products**, **transactions**, and **subscriptions** from 2023–2025.

### Files
- `capstone_unified_dataset.csv`
- `capstone_customers.csv`
- `capstone_products.csv`
- `capstone_transactions.csv`
- `capstone_subscriptions.csv`

## Run the Notebook
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
jupyter notebook Capstone_DSBA_Combined_Project.ipynb
```

## Learning Outcomes
- EDA & Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Feature Engineering (RFM, capping, joins)
- Hypothesis Testing (t-test, ANOVA)
- Classification (Gradient Boosting) – churn
- Regression (Random Forest) – CLV
- Clustering (KMeans) – segmentation
- Time-series trend (moving average)
- Actionable insights & recommendations
